# The Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ) Character Popularity & Meta Shift Tracker

### Introduction
The Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ) Character Popularity & Meta Shift Tracker is a data analytics project that analyzes YouTube content to quantify character popularity and detect meta shifts within Zenless Zone Zero. By leveraging the YouTube Data API v3, the project uses video metadata and engagement signals as a proxy for community interest and in-game relevance.

The system ingests YouTube data on a scheduled basis, transforms it into an analytics-ready schema, and produces time-series insights that highlight emerging trends, declining characters, and the impact of banners or patches. The project demonstrates end-to-end data pipeline design, metric modeling, and analytical reasoning using real-world, high-volume API data.
